    <h1>Perfectly Grilled Beef Steak</h1>
    <p>A Santa Maria tri-tip with a delicious spice rub is cooked on the grill until black-on-the-outside and perfectly pink inside for a spectacular steak. The tri-tip is cut from the bottom sirloin and when cooked properly, produces a very flavorful, incredibly juicy piece of beef. The town of Santa Maria, California, is home to this delicious barbecued beef specialty.</p>

    <h3><strong><u>Ingredients:</u></strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) beef roast</li>
        <li>⅓ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves crushed garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, rosemary, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Place beef in a glass baking dish and coat on all sides with spice mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours. </li>
        <li>Combine vinegar, vegetable oil, crushed garlic, and Dijon mustard in a sealable container. Cover the container and shake until ingredients are blended. </li>
        <li> Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator. Let sit uncovered at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; lightly oil the grates. </li>
        <li>Place tri-tip on the preheated grill and brush with vinegar mixture. Cook for 4 minutes, flip, and baste. Flip and baste every 4 minutes until tri-tip starts to firm up and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 25 to 30 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
